# API discovery and search experience in your developer portal

For the last few years the API community has been doing research around the best ways for humans and services to catalog APIs automatically inside an organization.
The challenge is getting harder and harder, as companies are getting more API-driven, with hundreds of services spread in the whole organizations.

There are few solutions that exist like Netflix Zuluu, and sometimes related to orchestration and scalability.

We devised two different approaches to automate the delivery of your API documentation:

1. [Using the `apis.json` format](doc/apis.json.md)
2. [Using 3scale ActiveDocs along with a customization of the built-in CMS](activedocs.md)
